My first app built using React + Web3 following [this tutorial](https://dev.to/ccoyotedev/building-an-aavegotchi-dapp-using-react-web3-2noe). To see Gotch photos, you need to [configure MetaMask](https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/metamask/config-matic/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### yarn start

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### yarn build

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
